    <h2>Marinated Grilled Shrimp</h2>
    <p>
      Learn how to marinate shrimp for grilling with this easy marinade that
      makes your shrimp so yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce. Don't let
      the cayenne pepper scare you — you don't even taste it. It is also a big
      hit with company and easy to prepare. I make this with frozen or fresh
      shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for
      outdoor grilling. Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread.
