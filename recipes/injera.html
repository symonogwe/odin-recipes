    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A naturally fermented, spongy, gluten-free flatbread from Ethiopia is made
      from teff flour and water, using wild yeast to ferment over a couple of
      days. It is then cooked like a crepe and turned into a flavorful, tangy
      bread to serve with your favorite Ethiopian food. The fermentation process
      can take up to 2 or 3 days, depending on your climate. Injera is typically
      served with vegetables and/or meat on top where the bread is actually an
      eating utensil.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup white teff flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup brown teff flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white teff flour, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons water, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps/Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix 1/2 cup white teff flour and brown teff flour together in a bowl.
        Add 1 cup water and whisk well. Pour mixture into a glass container
        large enough to hold 3 times the original volume. Cover with cheesecloth
        or other breathable fabric to keep out dust; do not seal with plastic
        wrap as air circulation is vital. Leave covered container in a
        draft-free environment; the mixture needs air to be circulated in order
        to ferment. Stir batter 2 times over 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for bubbles and possibly an increase in volume after 24 hours;
        there may also be a slightly tangy and sour smell. When you notice these
        things, add 1 tablespoon white teff flour and 1 tablespoon water to the
        batter and whisk well. Check in a few hours to see if bubbles have again
        formed, mixture has increased in volume, and the pungent smell is still
        evident; if so, the batter is ready and you can skip to the cooking
        process (step 5).
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave batter to rest another 12 hours if the mixture has not begun to
        form or smell sour after the first 24 hours; stir once during this time.
        Check to see if bubbles have formed, mixture has increased in volume,
        and a pungent smell is evident; if so, proceed with step 4.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together 2 tablespoons white teff flour and 2 tablespoons water in a
        bowl, making sure there are no lumps. Add mixture to the batter,
        whisking well. Wait a few hours; batter should be bubbly with a
        noticeable increase in volume and a pungent but fragrant smell,
        indicating it is ready to be cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add oil.
        Pour a scant 1/2 cup batter slowly and steadily into the hot pan in a
        circular motion from outside to inside. Cover the pan completely in a
        spiral without swirling. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook,
        allowing steam to cook the top of the bread, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from
        pan with spatula and transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. Repeat
        with remaining batter.
